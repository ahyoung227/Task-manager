## About The Project
<p> When organizing a bunch of people that need to do tasks, there are always people who aren't on top of stuff. Task coordinators then have to do extra work to push people and processes forward, get a status check on the overall situation(s), through redundant and repetitive communication. This tool will organize tasks and specifications of tasks and communication tool to help owners and subscribers to simplify the communication of task status to each other.</p>
